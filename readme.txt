Our project is worth 100 points because:

* Visuals
The team created the main character and the enemy appearance from scratch, which is significant because this took more time than simply using photos from the internet. 
There was a huge amount of thought that went into creating a layout that had an aesthtically pleasing appearance.
The overall design appearance and determining the color schemes to go together took quite a bit of time to create. 

* Effectively handling collisions
Collisions were handled so that there are implications if an enemy or obstacle runs into the main character.
If an enemy runs into the character, then the game is over. If an obstacle runs into the character, then the game score decreases. 
This is significant in our design because it was time consuming to create implications that are dependant upon the specific object type. 

* Creating a game that could infinitely run
It was slightly challenging to figure out how to have the gameboard redrawn frequently, as well as determining how often this needed to be updated to create the "moving" appearance of the board. 

This was a challenge for the team because there was the need to allow for certain events to occur with a time aspect rather than what we have mainly used in class by utilizing user interaction.
The new enemy and obstacle creation was dependent upon a random amount of elapsed time, which was different than what we have done in class. This took quite a bit of further research and practice to implement.

* Scoring
The scoring is significant because this is the whole point of the game. The player wants to try and get as high of a score as possible.
We implemented storing the score locally in order to determine if the player can beat their high score. This was a little bit of a challenge in order to figure out how to store this information locally. 
It was also significant to decrease the overall score count when the user runs into a block, as discussed above.
